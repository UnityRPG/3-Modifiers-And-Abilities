# Setup and Standards Doc
The purpose of this short doc is to get us all on the same page regarding
a few important things such as world scale, layers, prefab setups, etc.

## World Scale & Origin
We will be using Unity's default 1 m = 1 Unity Unit. Note animations don't
scale well. Y=100m is the deepest water bottom. All terrains at Y=-100, flatten land to +100.

## Layers
So far the layers of note are `Walkable` and `Enemy`, and are self-explanatory in their use.
Note it is the collider that receives the raycast, so do apply layers to children.

## Labels
The SceneSetup label contains prefabs that must be added to new scenes.

## Ramp angles
Maximum ramp Z value = 15
For a longer ramp = 10
